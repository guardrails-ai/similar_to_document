## Description

The objective of this validator is to ensure that any LLM-generated text is similar (in content) to a previously known document text. This validator works comparing the LLM generated text with a known “good” document text based on cosine similarity.

### Intended use

The primary intended uses of this validator is if a “golden” output is known for a similar subject when generating an LLM output. E.g., there’s previous historical data about a support QA system, and we want to ensure that any new LLM generated text will be similar to historical “golden” QA.

### Resources required

* Dependencies:
    - `sentence-transformers`
- Foundation model access keys: Yes, if commercial embedding model used

## Installation

```bash
guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/similar_to_document
```

## Usage Examples

### Validating string output via Python

In this example, we apply the validator to a string output generated by an LLM.

```python
# Import Guard and Validator
from guardrails import Guard
from guardrails.hub import SimilarToDocument

# Initialize The Guard with this validator
guard = Guard().use(
    SimilarToDocument,
    document="""
    Large language models (LLM) are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data. 
    The underlying transformer is a set of neural networks that consist of an encoder and a decoder with self-attention capabilities. 
    The encoder and decoder extract meanings from a sequence of text and understand the relationships between words and phrases in it.
    Transformer LLMs are capable of unsupervised training, although a more precise explanation is that transformers perform self-learning. 
    It is through this process that transformers learn to understand basic grammar, languages, and knowledge.

## API Reference

**`__init__(self, document, threshold=0.7, model="all-MiniLM-L6-v2", on_fail="noop")`**
<ul>

Initializes a new instance of the Validator class.

**Parameters:**

- **`document`** _(str):_ The text of the document to use for the similarity check.
- **`threshold`** _(float):_ The minimum cosine similarity to be considered similar. Defaults to 0.7.
- **`model`** _(str):_ The embedding model to use. Defaults to "all-MiniLM-L6-v2". Check the [sentence-transformers documentation](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) for available models.
- **`on_fail`** *(str, Callable):* The policy to enact when a validator fails. If `str`, must be one of `reask`, `fix`, `filter`, `refrain`, `noop`, `exception` or `fix_reask`. Otherwise, must be a function that is called when the validator fails.

</ul>

<br>

**`__call__(self, value, metadata={}) → ValidationResult`**

<ul>

Validates the given `value` using the rules defined in this validator, relying on the `metadata` provided to customize the validation process. This method is automatically invoked by `guard.parse(...)`, ensuring the validation logic is applied to the input data.

Note:

1. This method should not be called directly by the user. Instead, invoke `guard.parse(...)` where this method will be called internally for each associated Validator.
2. When invoking `guard.parse(...)`, ensure to pass the appropriate `metadata` dictionary that includes keys and values required by this validator. If `guard` is associated with multiple validators, combine all necessary metadata into a single dictionary.

**Parameters:**

- **`value`** *(Any):* The input value to validate.
- **`metadata`** *(dict):* A dictionary containing metadata required for validation. No additional metadata keys are needed for this validator.

</ul>
